# OLTP_For_Ecommerce_Platform_PLSQL

This repository contains an implementation of an Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) system for an E-commerce platform using PL/SQL. The system utilizes a data model designed for an Oracle database and employs stored procedures and triggers to execute OLTP operations efficiently.
